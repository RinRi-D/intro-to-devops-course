# Amirlan Sharipov - Task 1 (DevOps principles)

## Collaboration
To bring dev, ops, and other people together efficient communication and collaboration is essential. For example, to make the development and deployment process painless, DevOps automate many things, but it's important to fulfill other people's need. One way might be convenient for developers, but for others it may cause problems. That's why it's important to communicate and make decisions together.

## Use the right tools
By choosing the right tools that can integrate into the current workflow is essential for DevOps engineers. For example, by using ELK stack with native logging systems, it's easy and efficient to monitor and analyse logs.

## Automate everything that can be easily automated
DevOps engineers automate deployment, testing, integration, and other parts of software development life cycle. DevOps teams build tools, so that newly commited features will be tested and deployed quickly and painlessly.

## Speed up release time or continuous improvement
By automating repetitive tasks such as testing and deployment, DevOps engineers allow others to do their jobs more efficiently without wasting any unnecessary time. By doing that the release time will be continuously improving. To test or deploy a program, developers don't need to manually do it, because DevOps engineer can automate this proccess.

## Focus on the end users
Live monitoring and fast deployment built by DevOps teams allow them to focus on the end users' needs. This allows the development to go in the right direction by watching how the real users interact with the software.
