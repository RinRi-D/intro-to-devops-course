# Amirlan Sharipov - Task 2 (Scenarios)

## Developers are too slow to release
Let's say in some company testing and deployment takes a lot of time - it's not automated properly. By applying continuous improvement and automating testing and deployment, DevOps teams will improve the release time.

## There is a bug or a problem on testing or production
Testing, logging, and monitoring systems will help to identify problems faster.

## Improve collaboration in a team with lots of members
By using software like mattermost, collaboration and communication becomes more efficient even in big teams.
